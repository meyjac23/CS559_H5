I have included all 4 requirements for this assignment
    1. You can move the camera around the world and adjust its height with 2 sliders
    2. It includes multiple parametric curves (Hermite)
    3. With the way the lines cross and curve, it is apparent this is in 3D
    4. After visual and manual inspection, you can tell I use an orthographic projection

I have also included an object that moves along this path, changing its orientation and doing flips as it goes.
